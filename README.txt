Goal: This project is for creating a console application that obtains the references and their configurations of SolidWorks parts, assemblies, and drawings. 

Compiling Prerequisites: You must have the SolidWorks Document Manger Key to compile this code.  You need a C# compiler with .NET 4.  I used the Microsoft Visual C# 2010 Express.

Binary Use Prerequisites: You must have .NET 4.  I am not sure if this will run with mono.
